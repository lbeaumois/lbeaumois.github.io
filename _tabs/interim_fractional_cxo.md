## Interim/Fractional CXO

Scale-ups face a unique challenge: they need C-level expertise to navigate critical growth phases, but may not need or be able to afford a full-time executive. I provide experienced, hands-on leadership to help companies bridge that gap.

### Executive Roles

I step into senior leadership positions to drive results during critical periods:

**Chief Executive Officer (CEO)**
- Strategic vision and execution
- Fundraising and investor relations
- Board management and governance
- M&A strategy and execution
- Crisis management and turnarounds

**Chief Technology Officer (CTO)**
- Technology strategy and roadmap
- Engineering team leadership and scaling
- Product architecture and technical debt management
- R&D and innovation initiatives
- Vendor and partner relationships

**Chief Operating Officer (COO)**
- Operational excellence and process optimization
- Cross-functional team alignment
- Scalability planning and execution
- Customer success and support operations
- Supply chain and delivery management

**Chief Revenue Officer (CRO)**
- Revenue growth strategy and execution
- Sales and marketing alignment
- Pricing and packaging optimization
- Customer acquisition and retention
- Channel strategy and partnerships

### Board Member Services

I provide strategic guidance and governance as a board member for startups and scale-ups:

**Board Responsibilities**
- Strategic planning and oversight
- Financial performance and risk management
- CEO coaching and performance evaluation
- M&A evaluation and execution support
- Investor relations and shareholder value

**Areas of Expertise**
- B2B SaaS business models
- AI and technology strategy
- Financial services and fintech
- International expansion (especially EMEA)
- Revenue growth and operational scaling

### When to Engage

**Ideal Scenarios for Interim/Fractional Executives:**
- **Growth Transition**: Scaling from startup to scale-up (Series A-C)
- **Executive Search**: Bridging the gap while recruiting permanent leadership
- **Transformation**: Navigating strategic pivots or major change initiatives
- **Crisis Management**: Addressing urgent operational or financial challenges
- **Special Projects**: Leading complex initiatives (M&A, fundraising, restructuring)

### My Approach

**1. Rapid Onboarding (Weeks 1-2)**
- Immerse in company operations, culture, and metrics
- Assess strengths, gaps, and immediate priorities
- Align with board and leadership team on objectives

**2. Strategic Execution (Months 1-6)**
- Implement quick wins to build momentum
- Execute long-term strategic initiatives
- Build and empower teams for sustainable success
- Establish systems and processes for scale

**3. Transition Planning (Final Phase)**
- Prepare organization for permanent leadership or independence
- Document processes and knowledge transfer
- Support recruitment and onboarding of successors

### Track Record

**Wiiisdom (Boston, MA)** - Leadership role driving digital transformation and AI implementation in scale-up environment

**SAP** - Demonstrated C-level impact:
- Top Talent 2016 (elite performer recognition)
- EMEA Key Contributor Q4 2015 (€3M+ deal)
- Winners' Circle 2014-2015 (Global Quota Club)

### Engagement Models

**Interim (Full-time)**

**Fractional (Part-time)**
