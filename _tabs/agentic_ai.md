## Agentic AI / MCP

The future of business automation isn't just AI—it's **autonomous AI agents** that can reason, plan, and act independently. I help B2B SaaS companies and Financial Services firms harness agentic AI to drive competitive advantage and operational efficiency.

### What is Agentic AI?

Unlike traditional AI that simply predicts or classifies, agentic AI systems:
- **Reason** through complex problems autonomously
- **Plan** multi-step workflows and adapt to changing conditions
- **Act** by executing tasks and making decisions
- **Learn** from outcomes to improve performance

This represents a fundamental shift from AI-as-a-tool to AI-as-a-workforce.
