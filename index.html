## Transform Your Business with Expert Leadership & Cutting-Edge AI

Are you a B2B SaaS scale-up or Financial Services firm navigating critical growth challenges? I provide the executive leadership, strategic guidance, and technical expertise you need to drive revenue growth, operational excellence, and competitive advantage.

### How I Can Help You

#### 👔 [Interim/Fractional CXO](/interim_fractional_cxo/)

**Get C-level expertise without the full-time commitment.**

Scale-ups need senior leadership during critical phases—but may not need a permanent executive. I step into CEO, CTO, COO, or CRO roles (full-time or fractional) to drive results during transitions, growth spurts, or transformation initiatives. I also serve on boards of startups and scale-ups.

**Executive roles:** Interim CEO/CTO/COO/CRO • Board Member • Crisis Management • Transformation Leadership

#### 🤖 [Agentic AI / MCP](/agentic_ai/)

**Harness autonomous AI agents to revolutionize your operations.**

The future isn't just AI—it's autonomous agents that reason, plan, and act independently. I help you understand, adopt, and build agentic AI systems including single agents, multi-agent orchestras, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. From strategy to implementation, I guide you through the AI transformation.

**AI expertise:** AI Strategy & Roadmap • Team Enablement & Training • Single Agent Systems • Multi-Agent Orchestration • MCP Server Development
