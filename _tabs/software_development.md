**1. Discovery & Planning (Week 1-2)**
- Requirements gathering and validation
- Technical architecture design
- Technology stack selection
- Timeline and resource planning
- Risk assessment and mitigation

**2. Iterative Development (Agile/Scrum)**
- 2-week sprint cycles
- Continuous integration and testing
- Regular demos and stakeholder feedback
- Incremental feature delivery
- Technical documentation

**3. Quality Assurance**
